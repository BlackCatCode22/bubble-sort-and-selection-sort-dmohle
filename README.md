tJavaSorts01a - Bubble Sort and Selection Sort

CIT-63 class exercise on Oct 26, 2023

Instructions:

Code up the bubble sort and the selection sort in Java.

Ask ChatGPT to calculate the Big O notation for each of your sorts and
have ChatGPT explain Big O notation!

Sure thing! Let's change the bag to a deck of cards and explain bubble sort to our smart 12-year-old with that analogy.

Imagine you have a deck of playing cards, and your mission is to arrange them in order from the lowest (Ace) to the 
highest (King). Bubble sort is like a simple way of doing this:

You start by looking at the first card (Ace) and the second card (Two). If the first card (Ace) is higher than the 
second card (Two), you swap them.

Then, you move to the second card (now possibly Two) and compare it to the third card (Three). If the second card 
(Two) is higher than the third card (Three), you swap them.

You keep doing this for every pair of cards in your deck, one pair at a time, until you go through the entire deck 
without having to swap any cards.

If you did have to make some swaps during a pass through the deck, you start over and go through the deck again 
because you might still have some cards out of order. You keep doing this until you go through the whole deck without any swaps.

This process repeats until you've gone through the entire deck without any swaps happening in one pass. It's called 
"bubble sort" because, just like bubbles rising in a glass of soda, the smaller cards (like Ace and Two) "bubble" their way to the top of the deck.

Now, let's talk about the Big O notation again. Big O notation is like a way to describe how long it takes to sort 
the cards based on how many cards you have. For bubble sort:

If you have just a few cards in your deck, it's not too bad. You can sort them relatively quickly by comparing and 
swapping adjacent cards.

But as you add more cards to your deck, it takes longer and longer because you have to go through all the cards many 
times, and each pass might involve swapping cards.

So, in Big O notation, bubble sort is described as O(n^2), which means that if you have n cards in your deck, it might 
take roughly n^2 (n squared) comparisons and swaps to sort them all. This is not very efficient, especially if you have a lot of cards in your deck.

There are faster sorting methods like quicksort and mergesort, which are like using magic tricks to sort your deck much 
faster, but bubble sort helps you understand the basics of sorting with playing cards.
